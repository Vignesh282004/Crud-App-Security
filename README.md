- It Contains Admin and User Roles in which Admin can do Some tasks like Deletion which a Normal User Can't.
- Technology Stack: The project leverages the power of Spring Boot, a popular Java framework, for creating a web application. Thymeleaf is used as the template engine to build dynamic HTML pages, and Spring Security ensures robust user authentication and authorization.

- CRUD Functionality: The application provides Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for managing data. Users can add, view, modify, and delete records in a user-friendly web interface.
- User Authentication and Authorization: Spring Security is employed to enhance the security of the application. Users must log in to access the CRUD operations, and their access is controlled based on roles and permissions. This ensures that only authorized users can perform specific actions.
- User-Friendly UI with Thymeleaf: Thymeleaf is used to create a user-friendly and dynamic web interface. It allows the presentation of data in HTML templates, making it easier to integrate with the backend while providing a smooth user experience.

- Database Interaction: The project likely interacts with a database to store and retrieve data. Spring Data JPA or other data access technologies may be used to simplify database operations.
- Validation : Input data is validated to ensure data integrity.
- -Role-Based Access Control: Different user roles, such as admin and regular user, can be defined. Role-based access control restricts certain operations to specific roles, providing a fine-grained access control system.
